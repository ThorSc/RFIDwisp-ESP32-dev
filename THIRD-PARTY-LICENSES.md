# Third-party licenses

This firmware (`wt32sc01plus/`) is built with [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/)
on the Arduino framework for ESP32 and pulls in the libraries listed in
`wt32sc01plus/platformio.ini` (`lib_deps`). All of them end up statically
linked into the firmware binary. This file lists each one, its license, and
what that means for redistributing the built firmware.

## LGPL-2.1 components (Arduino-ESP32 core, Arduino_MFRC522v2)

These two are statically linked into `firmware.bin`, which LGPL-2.1 permits
for a device like this as long as the complete source needed to modify the
LGPL component and relink/rebuild the whole firmware is available - which it
is: this repository is public and `pio run` reproduces the exact build,
pinned to the library versions in `platformio.ini`/`platformio.lock`. If you
redistribute a modified build, keep that source available under the same
terms. Full license text: <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html>.
